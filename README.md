7-Day Advanced C# OOP Study Plan with Practice Checklist
Day 1 ‚Äì OOP Foundations (Classes & Objects)

Study:

Classes, Objects

Fields, Properties

Constructors (default, parameterized, copy)

Access Modifiers

Practice Checklist:

Create a Student class with name, age ‚Üí create multiple objects.

Add a constructor to initialize student details.

Create a Book class ‚Üí assign values using this keyword.

Try different access modifiers (make one field private, another public).

Create a Product class with a DisplayInfo() method.

Day 2 ‚Äì Encapsulation

Study:

Encapsulation

Getters & Setters (Properties in C#)

Auto-properties { get; set; }

Read-only & Write-only properties

Practice Checklist:

Create a BankAccount class ‚Üí balance is private, methods for Deposit & Withdraw.

Add a read-only property for Balance.

Add validation: prevent withdrawing more than balance.

Create Employee class with salary as private, expose only getter.

Create User class with password ‚Üí allow setting but not reading (write-only).

Day 3 ‚Äì Abstraction

Study:

Abstract classes & methods

Interfaces

Difference: Abstract vs Interface

Practice Checklist:

Create abstract class Shape with Area() method.

Implement Circle & Rectangle.

Create interface IVehicle with Drive().

Implement Car and Bike.

Create abstract Appliance ‚Üí implement WashingMachine, Fridge.

Write a program where one class uses multiple interfaces.

Revise: abstract class vs interface differences (write down examples).

Day 4 ‚Äì Inheritance

Study:

Types of Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)

Constructor Chaining with base

Method Hiding (new) vs Overriding (override)

Sealed classes & methods

Practice Checklist:

Create Person ‚Üí Derived Student, Teacher.

Create Animal ‚Üí Derived Dog ‚Üí Derived Puppy (Multilevel).

Use constructor chaining (base) in derived class.

Show method hiding (new) vs method overriding (override).

Create a sealed class and try inheriting (observe error).

Day 5 ‚Äì Polymorphism

Study:

Compile-time Polymorphism (Overloading, Operator Overloading)

Runtime Polymorphism (Overriding, Virtual methods)

Upcasting & Downcasting

Dynamic binding

Practice Checklist:

Create Calculator class with multiple Add() methods (overloading).

Create Animal ‚Üí override Speak() in Dog, Cat.

Demonstrate upcasting (Animal a = new Dog();).

Demonstrate downcasting (Dog d = (Dog)a;).

Try operator overloading (+ operator in a Complex class).

Day 6 ‚Äì Advanced OOP Features in C#

Study:

Static classes & members

Partial classes

Structs vs Classes

Indexers

Records (C# 9+)

Practice Checklist:

Create MathHelper static class with utility methods.

Split Student class into two files using partial class.

Create a PointStruct and PointClass, compare behavior.

Create a Library class with indexer (library[0]).

Create a record PersonRecord and compare with normal class.

Day 7 ‚Äì Delegates, Events & Final Integration

Study:

Delegates

Events (publisher-subscriber)

Anonymous methods & Lambda expressions

Event-driven OOP

Practice Checklist:

Create a delegate that references a method (CalculatorDelegate).

Create an event OnTransaction in BankAccount class.

Raise event when deposit/withdraw happens.

Use anonymous method with delegate.

Build Mini Project ‚Äì ATM Simulation (Encapsulation + Abstraction + Inheritance + Polymorphism + Events).

‚úÖ Tips for Execution

‚è∞ Spend 2‚Äì3 hrs study + 2‚Äì3 hrs coding daily.

üìí Maintain a notes file with definitions + differences (Encapsulation vs Abstraction, Abstract vs Interface, Hiding vs Overriding).

üíª Do all practice tasks ‚Üí they‚Äôll act as ready-made interview answers.
